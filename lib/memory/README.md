Should memory be only split into how memgpt does it with long term and short term memory, or would there be a benefit by sorting it into other types of memory.
Like fetching from specific categories of memory - such as "personal" when it relates to user, "event" when it is more outside the user itself or "subjects" for
more non-related knowledge outside both much like RAG data but read-write.

Will experiment when more is completed.
